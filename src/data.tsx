      "The original idea of this project is to build a general weather forecast web application leveraging Context Api and Open weather map RESTful service. However,not long after the small functionilty finished, the similarity of the search address became a obstacle when integrating Google Place Api seemed to be a preferable option. Imagination didn't like to be end here. Hence, I decided to implement some travel POIs web service to show beautiful scenery around Australia. The first try was tripadvisor Api and they turned me out since they choose selected clients. After that I have got the permission to use sygic travel Api with limited quota. It took several weeks to learn the data structure and different data request with satisfied content. My requst quota ran out at the same time the RESTful Application fully built in the website. But I came from a known-nothing mind to be the one that can requst specific data to display inside website.",
